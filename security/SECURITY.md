# YucaMedia Website Security Policy


This document outlines the security considerations and practices for the YucaMedia Website project.

## Foundational Principles

- **OWASP Top 10:** This project aims to identify and mitigate relevant risks outlined in the OWASP Top 10 list of critical web application security risks. Specific controls listed below often address one or more OWASP categories.

## 1. HTTPS Enforcement

- **Policy:** The production website MUST be served exclusively over HTTPS.
- **Implementation:** Configure redirection from HTTP to HTTPS at the hosting/CDN level.

## 2. Secure HTTP Headers

- **Policy:** Implement the following HTTP security headers via hosting configuration or middleware.
- **Headers:**
    - `Content-Security-Policy (CSP)`: **[Action Needed]** Define a strict policy based on final site resources. Start restrictive (e.g., `default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; script-src 'self';`) and refine as needed.
    - `X-Content-Type-Options`: `nosniff`
    - `X-Frame-Options`: `DENY` (or `SAMEORIGIN` if framing is required)
    - `Referrer-Policy`: `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
    - `Permissions-Policy`: **[Action Needed]** Define based on required browser features (e.g., `geolocation=(), microphone=()`).

## 3. Subresource Integrity (SRI)

- **Policy:** Any third-party JavaScript or CSS loaded from external CDNs MUST use the `integrity` attribute with a valid hash.
- **Verification:** Audit `<script>` and `<link>` tags pointing to external resources.

## 4. Dependency Management

- **Policy:** Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities and update promptly.
- **Tools:** Use `npm audit` (or equivalent for other package managers) as part of the development and CI/CD process.
- **Review:** Periodically review dependencies to remove unused ones.

## 5. Asset Security

- **Policy:** Ensure static assets (images, SVGs, fonts) do not contain malicious code or execute unintended scripts.
- **Verification:** Review SVGs for embedded scripts if sourced externally. Optimize images.

## 6. Wallet Interaction (Solana Integration)

- **Policy:** Wallet connection and transaction signing must be user-initiated, clear, and secure.
- **Principles:**
    - Request minimal necessary permissions.
    - Display human-readable transaction details before signing.
    - Protect against phishing (clear UI, domain verification).
    - Use established Solana wallet adapter libraries.

## 7. Input Validation

- **Policy:** All user-provided input and data fetched from external sources (including the blockchain) MUST be rigorously validated and sanitized on both client and server-side (where applicable).
- **Principle:** Never trust external input.

## 8. RPC Node Security

- **Policy:** Use trusted Solana RPC node providers.
- **Considerations:** Rate limiting, data privacy implications, potential fallback nodes.

## 9. Vulnerability Disclosure

- **Policy:** Provide a clear and responsible way for security researchers to report vulnerabilities.
- **Contact:** Security reports can be sent to `security@yucamedia.com` (**[Action Needed]** Replace with a real email address).

## 10. Accessibility Compliance

- **Policy:** The website MUST adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility standards.
- **Implementation:**
    - Use proper semantic HTML elements
    - Ensure sufficient color contrast
    - Provide text alternatives for non-text content
    - Ensure keyboard navigability
    - Include skip navigation links
    - Implement ARIA attributes where appropriate
